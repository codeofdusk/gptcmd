# Account Configuration
# The following sections configure Gptcmd's connections to OpenAI.
# By default, Gptcmd uses the [accounts.default] section on startup.
# If this section doesn't exist, Gptcmd uses the first account section it finds.
# You can add multiple accounts by creating additional sections:
# [accounts.first]
# [accounts.second]
# [accounts.custom_name]
# Each account section should contain connection details similar to [accounts.default].

# Within each account section (placed between its header and the next account's header), you can specify the following options:

# provider: This must be set to "openai".

# model: The OpenAI model that Gptcmd should use when this account is activated.
# Example:
# model = "gpt-4o-mini"

# api_key: The OpenAI API key to use. If omitted, Gptcmd reads it from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
# Example:
# api_key = "sk-xxxxxx"

# base_url: The endpoint URL to which Gptcmd should connect.
# With the "model" option, this option can be used to connect Gptcmd to third-party OpenAI-compatible APIs.
# Example:
# base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

# Any additional options are passed directly to the Python OpenAI client's constructor for this account.
